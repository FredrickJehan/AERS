        "abstract": "We introduce BUDA.ART, a system designed to assist researchers\r\nin Art History, to explore and analyze an archive of pictures of\r\nBuddha statues. The system combines different CBIR and classical\r\nretrieval techniques to assemble 2D pictures, 3D statue scans and\r\nmeta-data, that is focused on the Buddha facial characteristics. We\r\nbuild the system from an archive of 50,000 Buddhism pictures,\r\nidentify unique Buddha statues, extract contextual information,\r\nand provide specific facial embedding to first index the archive. The\r\nsystem allows for mobile, on-site search, and to explore similarities\r\nof statues in the archive. In addition, we provide search visualization\r\nand 3D analysis of the statues.\r\npdf: nasa gmail tig send ko.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has raised\r\nconcerns for many regarding personal and public health implications, financial security and\r\neconomic stability. Alongside many other\r\nunprecedented challenges, there are increasing concerns over social isolation and mental\r\nhealth. We introduce Expressive Interviewing\u2013\r\nan interview-style conversational system that\r\ndraws on ideas from motivational interviewing and expressive writing. Expressive Interviewing seeks to encourage users to express\r\ntheir thoughts and feelings through writing by\r\nasking them questions about how COVID-19\r\nhas impacted their lives. We present relevant\r\naspects of the system\u2019s design and implementation as well as quantitative and qualitative\r\nanalyses of user interactions with the system.\r\nIn addition, we conduct a comparative evaluation with a general purpose dialogue system\r\nfor mental health that shows our system potential in helping users to cope with COVID-19\r\nissues.",

        "abstract": "Despite the growth of e-commerce, brick-andmortar stores are still the preferred destinations for many people. In this paper, we\r\npresent ISA, a mobile-based intelligent shopping assistant that is designed to improve shopping experience in physical stores. ISA assists\r\nusers by leveraging advanced techniques in\r\ncomputer vision, speech processing, and natural language processing. An in-store user only\r\nneeds to take a picture or scan the barcode of\r\nthe product of interest, and then the user can\r\ntalk to the assistant about the product. The\r\nassistant can also guide the user through the\r\npurchase process or recommend other similar\r\nproducts to the user. We take a data-driven\r\napproach in building the engines of ISA\u2019s natural language processing component, and the\r\nengines achieve good performance\r\n",
