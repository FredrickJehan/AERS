For instance, depression is one of the most common mental health issues according to the findings made by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Depression can\r\ncause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19 pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multimodal features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific perspectives.",

Powerfully argued and thought-provoking, Terrorism and Global Disorder examines whether the world changed as a result of the events of 11 September 2001. It argues that the significance of 9\/11 has been overstated and that terrorism with a global reach is best seen as a consequence of other, more fundamental changes. The author contends that the development and global outreach of terrorism stem from the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the  superpower hegemony, aided by the spread of international technology and communications. He also examines the consequences of the political exploitation of terrorism and underlines the dangers created by the politicization of counter-terrorism for partisan purposes.",

Thermal physiology research has been ongoing since the late nineties. This research lies at the intersections of medicine, psychology, machine learning, optics, and affective computing. We\r\nwill review the known factors of thermal vs. RGB imaging for facial emotion recognition. But we also propose that thermal imagery may provide a semi-anonymous modality for computer vision, over RGB, which has been plagued by misuse in facial recognition. However, the transition to adopting thermal imagery as a source for any human-centered AI task is not easy and relies on the availability of high fidelity data sources across multiple demographics and thorough validation. This paper takes the reader on a short review of machine learning in thermal FER and the limitations of collecting and developing thermal FER data for AI training. Our motivation is to provide an introductory overview into recent advances for thermal FER and stimulate conversation about the limitations in current datasets.",
