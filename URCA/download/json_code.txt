Many sate-of-the-art neural networks have been proved, to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. These failures of machine learning models demonstrate that even simple algorithms can behave very differently from what their designers intend to. In order to close this gap between what designers intend to and how algorithms behave, there is a huge need for preventing adversarial examples to improve the credibility of the model. This study focuses on synthesizing adversarial examples using two different white box attacks - Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Expectation Over Transfromation (EOT) Method.",

        "abstract": "Emotions are a central key for understanding human beings and of fundamental importance regarding their impact in human and animal behaviors.\r\nThey have been for a long time a subject of study for various scholars including in particular philosophers and mystics [5, 7, 27, 29, 22, 31, 35, 36]. In\r\nmodern science, the emotional phenomenon has attracted for a few decades\r\nan increasing number of studies, notably in the fields of Psychology, Psychiatry, Neuroscience and Biochemistry [1, 3, 2, 9, 11, 17, 16, 19, 20, 23,\r\n24, 25, 26, 32, 34]. However, since our perception of emotions is not, so\r\nfar, directly detectable nor recordable by our measure instruments, Physics\r\nand Mathematics have not been so far used academically to provide a precise description of the phenomenon of feeling an emotion. Relying upon the\r\nworks of O. Elahi [10, 14] and on the hypothesis that the human soul and its\r\npsyche may manifest in ourselves (in both conscious and unconscious manner) in an analog way as electromagnetic waves [13], we propose here a few\r\nmathematical descriptions consistent with the human personal experience,\r\nof the feeling and cognition of emotions.",

        "abstract": "In the past years, e-Science applications have evolved from large-scale simulations executed in a single cluster to more complex workflows where these\r\nsimulations are combined with High-Performance Data Analytics (HPDA). To\r\nimplement these workflows, developers are currently using different patterns;\r\nmainly task-based and dataflow. However, since these patterns are usually managed by separated frameworks, the implementation of these applications requires\r\nto combine them; considerably increasing the effort for learning, deploying, and\r\nintegrating applications in the different frameworks.\r\nThis paper tries to reduce this effort by proposing a way to extend taskbased management systems to support continuous input and output data to\r\nenable the combination of task-based workflows and dataflows (Hybrid Workflows from now on) using a single programming model. Hence, developers can\r\nbuild complex Data Science workflows with different approaches depending on\r\nthe requirements. To illustrate the capabilities of Hybrid Workflows, we have\r\nbuilt a Distributed Stream Library and a fully functional prototype extending\r\nCOMPSs, a mature, general-purpose, task-based, parallel programming model.",

The notion of the robopsychology\r\nas a fictional science and a fictional occupation was introduced by Asimov\r\nin the middle of the last century. The robophilosophy, on the other hand,\r\nis only a few years old today. But at this moment, none of these new\r\nemerging disciplines focus on the fundamental and overall issues of the\r\ndevelopment of artificial general intelligence. Instead, they focus only on\r\nissues that, although are extremely important, play a complementary role,\r\nsuch as moral or ethical ones, rather than the big questions of life. We try\r\nto outline a conception in which the robophilosophy and robopsychology\r\nwill be able to play a similar leading rule in the progress of artificial intelligence than the philosophy and psychology have done in the progress of\r\nhuman intelligence.",
